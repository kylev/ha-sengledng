# HACS Sengled for Home Assistant

__This is beta code__

This is a [HACS](https://hacs.xyz/) integration to connect Sengled Wifi lights to [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/). It uses the modernized Platform/Entity and MQTT programming interfaces, but is based on [jfarmer08](https://github.com/jfarmer08)'s [excellent initial work](https://github.com/jfarmer08/ha-sengledapi).

Tested with:

- W21-N13
- W21-N11

## Configuration

In the Home Assistant Settings nagivate to "Devices and Settings" and use the "+Add Integration" button. Search for "Sengled NG" and provide your login credentials.
